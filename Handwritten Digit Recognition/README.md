# Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN
This project focuses on performing handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).The goal is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify handwritten digits from images.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) dataset, which is widely used for handwritten digit recognition tasks.
The training data set (train.csv) contains 785 columns, each containing a pixel-value representing the digit drawn by the user.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of building and training a CNN model for handwritten digit recognition using the [Digit Recognizer](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/digit-recognizer/data) dataset. 
By following the instructions and running the provided code, you can develop a CNN model that accurately classifies handwritten digits. 
This project serves as a starting point for more complex image recognition tasks and provides a foundation for further exploration and improvement.
