# Plant Disease Detection 
This project aims to develop a plant disease detection model using deep learning techniques. The model will analyze images of plants and accurately classify them as healthy or diseased, 
as well as identify the specific disease if present.

## Dataset
The project utilizes [PlantVillage Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset) that includes samples of healthy plants and plants affected by various diseases. 
The dataset should be properly organized into training, validation, and test sets. Each set should have separate directories for each class containing the respective images.

## Model Architecture
The plant disease detection model is built using deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
The architecture can be customized based on your requirements and the characteristics of the dataset. Transfer learning was be employed by utilizing pre-trained model => MobileNet.
Transfer learning can be employed by utilizing pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception, and adding custom top layers for classification. 
The model should be trained to achieve high accuracy and generalization on the task of plant disease detection.

## Conclusion
The plant disease detection involves training a deep learning model to accurately classify plant images as healthy or diseased, and potentially identify specific diseases. 
By following the steps outlined in this readme, you can develop an effective plant disease detection model that can aid in timely disease identification.
